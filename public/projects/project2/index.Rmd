We first the latest data by running the following the GET request.

```{r, get_tfl_data}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))
```
We then perform some data preprocessing.
```{r}
# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))

bike_filtered <- bike %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2020)) %>%
                  group_by(year, month) %>%
                  summarise(avgMonth=mean(bikes_hired))

bike_monthly_average <- bike_filtered %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2019)) %>%
                  group_by(month) %>%
                  summarise(year_avgMonth=mean(avgMonth))

# Change month to numeric
bike_filtered$month <- as.numeric(bike_filtered$month)

# Change month to numeric
bike_monthly_average$month <- as.numeric(bike_monthly_average$month)


bike_left_join_1 <-left_join(bike_filtered,bike_monthly_average, by="month")

bike_left_join_2 <- bike_left_join_1 %>%
  mutate(diff_month = avgMonth-year_avgMonth)


bike_left_join_2
```


Before we move into replicating the graph, lets study the underlying distributions.

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

It seems like the distributions in 2020 have a smaller peak and are much wider than the previous years. It seems like the Covid-19 pandemic seems to have change people's behaviours in renting bikes. People are not renting many bikes due to the current lockdowns.


```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)


```


```{r }


bike_left_join_2$month <- as.numeric(bike_left_join_2$month)
bike_left_join_2$month <- as.factor(bike_left_join_2$month)

ggplot(data=bike_left_join_2, aes(x=month , y=year_avgMonth, group=1)) + facet_wrap(~year) + 
labs(x=NULL, y="Bike Rentals", caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store", title="Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle= "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019") + theme_minimal(base_family="Arial") + theme (plot.title = element_text(size=10), plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9))+
  #+ geom_line(aes(x=month, y = year_avgMonth), size=1.2, colour="blue") +
#+ geom_line(aes(x=month, y=avgMonth), color="black", size=1.2)
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year_avgMonth + if_else(diff_month < 0, diff_month, 0),
                  ymax = year_avgMonth), color ="grey", fill = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year_avgMonth,
                  ymax = year_avgMonth + if_else(diff_month > 0, diff_month, 0)),color ="grey", fill = "green", alpha = 0.3)+ theme(aspect.ratio=0.5) + theme(axis.text.x= element_text(size=5)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))+ geom_line(color="blue")
  
```


The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, we calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. More specifically, we use the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

We used means as expected rentals as the data is approximaately normally distributed.

```{r}

bike_filtered_week <- bike %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2020)) %>%
                  group_by(year, week) %>%
                  summarise(avgWeek_filtered_week=mean(bikes_hired))

bike_weekly_average <- bike_filtered_week %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2019)) %>%
                  group_by(week) %>%
                  summarise(avgWeek_weekly_average=mean(avgWeek_filtered_week)) 

bike_joined_full <- left_join(bike_filtered_week, bike_weekly_average, by = "week")


bike_joined_full_2 <- bike_joined_full %>%
  mutate(excessrentalspercent = (avgWeek_filtered_week - avgWeek_weekly_average)*100/avgWeek_weekly_average) 

```
 Finally, we produce the plots.
```{r}
ggplot(bike_joined_full_2, aes(x=week, y=excessrentalspercent)) + 
  labs(title= "Weekly Changes in TFL Bike Rentals", subtitle=" % changes from weekly averages calculated between 2015-2019", x="week", y=NULL, caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store") +
  facet_wrap(~year)+ geom_line(fill="black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = excessrentalspercent - if_else(excessrentalspercent < 0, excessrentalspercent, 0),
                  ymax = excessrentalspercent), color ="grey", fill = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = excessrentalspercent,
                  ymax = excessrentalspercent - if_else(excessrentalspercent > 0, excessrentalspercent, 0)),color ="grey", fill = "green", alpha = 0.3) + 
   scale_x_discrete(limits = c(13, 26, 39, 53)) +
  geom_rect(xmin=13, xmax=26, ymin=-150, ymax=150, fill="grey", alpha=0.01) +geom_rect(xmin=39, xmax=52,ymin=-150, ymax=150,
                                                                                          fill="grey", alpha=0.01) +
  geom_rug(sides="b", aes(colour=ifelse(excessrentalspercent > 0, "red", "green")), alpha=0.2) +
  theme(legend.position='none') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, "%"))
```
