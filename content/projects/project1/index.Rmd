```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center")
```

First, we load all the relevants library into R. This ensures that we are able to use all functions required later on. 

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
```



# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. This dataset be a good source into how drinking behaviours differ in countries.


Let us load the dataset.

```{r, load_alcohol_data, cache=TRUE}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

We then perform simple EDA.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)
```

There are four numeric variables: *beer_servings*, *spirit_servings*, *wine_servings*, and *total_liters_of_pure_alcohol*. 

In addition, there is one character variable, *country* and no missing values.


With this, we can start modelling. First, we start by looking at beer consumptions across differing countries. 


```{r beer_plot}
top25_beer <- top_n(drinks, 25, beer_servings)

ggplot(data = top25_beer, mapping = aes (y = reorder(country, beer_servings), x = beer_servings)) + geom_col(fill='beige') + labs(title = "Who drinks the most beer?", subtitle = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries",
y = "Country", x = "Beer Servings (12-ounce cans of beer consumed per person)") +
NULL

  
```
**Country vs Beer consumption** bar charts show that beer is the most popular in Eastern European, African, and Central American countries. Namibia seems to be the top beer drinkers followed closely by Czech Republic and Gabon.
Russian Federation, Brazil and Andorra drink the least beer.

```{r wine_plot}
top25_wine <- top_n(drinks, 25, wine_servings)
ggplot(data = top25_wine, mapping = aes (y = reorder(country, wine_servings), x = wine_servings)) +   geom_col(fill='pink') +
labs(title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries",
y = "Country", x = "Wine Servings (glasses of wine per person per year)") +
NULL

```
**Country vs Wine consumption** bar chart shows that wine is most popular in Western European, Scandinavian, and South American countries. **France** is the top wine consumer.

```{r spirit_plot}
top25_spirits <- top_n(drinks, 25, spirit_servings)
ggplot(data = top25_spirits, mapping = aes (y = reorder(country, spirit_servings), x = spirit_servings)) + geom_col(fill='light green') + labs(title = "Top 25 Spirits Consuming Countries",
y = "Country", x = "Spirits Servings (measures of spirit per year)") +
NULL

```
Furthermore, **Country vs Spirit Consumption** shows that spirits tend to be popular in Eastern European and some Asian countries as well as on islands. **Grenada** drinks the most spirit while **Mongolia** drinks the least.


Overall, the bar charts show two trends. First one is that countries that are large exporters of a certain product tend to be the highest consumers. For example France and Portugal are among the top wine consuming countries, Czech Republic is the second in the beer chart, whereas Russia and Belarus are among the top countries for spirits consumption (which includes Vodka for example). It also seems that overall more developed countries enjoy more wine consumption, whereas less developed countries enjoy more beer and spirits consumption. This is expected as wine is usually more expensive and can be associated with prestige (especially if it is old!)
