# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). 


Let us load the required libraries.

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
library(scales)
```

Load the dataset. There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. 

```{r, cache= TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"


# Use `vroom` function is used to load the table as the file is lare.
covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()
library(scales)
```
Select relevant columns and calculate death rates with this formula:

death_rate = Number of deaths/Total Deaths x 100

```{r}
# Create a death_rate_comorbidities column
covid_death_rate_comorbidities<-covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),medcond_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% #filter for relevant values
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,medcond_yn) %>% 
  group_by(sex,age_group,medcond_yn) %>% 
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,medcond_yn,death_rate)

# Change labels for better clarity
new_labels<-c('Yes'='With Comorbidities','No'='Without Comorbidities')
```
Now , we plot a graph of Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and presence of co-morbidities.
```{r}
ggplot(covid_death_rate_comorbidities,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='blue')+
facet_grid(medcond_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(medcond_yn=new_labels))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,72))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title = "Does presence of co affect Covid death rates?", subtitle='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and presence of co-morbidities',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9))

```
From this graph, we can see: 
1. Older groups have a higher death rates. E.g. 67.3 for males above 80 years old with co-morbidities.
2. Death rate for males are higher than females. (In 50-59 year group without co-morbidities, 0.4% females died vs 1.4% male )
3. For a particular gender and age group, covid patients who are admitted into ICU die at a higher rate compared to those not admitted. 

This shows that increased age and presence of **co-morbidities** is correlated with higher death rate.

Next, we plot a graph of Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and ICU admission. 
```{r}
# Create a death_rate_icu column
covid_death_rate_icu<-covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),icu_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,icu_yn) %>% 
  group_by(sex,age_group,icu_yn) %>% 
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,icu_yn,death_rate)

# Adjust labels
new_labels_icu<-c('Yes'='Admitted to ICU','No'='No ICU')

# Plot death rate vs ICU admission faceted by sex and ICU admissions
ggplot(covid_death_rate_icu,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='#ffa084')+
facet_grid(icu_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(icu_yn=new_labels_icu))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,85))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title = "Does admission to ICU affect Covid death rates?", subtitle='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and weather patient was admitted to ICU',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9)) 

```
Here are some observations from this plot: 
1. Older groups have a higher death rates. E.g. 81.1 for males above 80 years old admitted to ICU.
2. Death rate for males are higher than females.
3. For a particular gender and age group, covid patients who are admitted into ICU die at a higher rate compared to those not admitted.

It is important that c**orrelation does not equate causation**. In the context of this question, this is to say that old age and ICU admission **does not cause** an increase death amongst Covid patients.
